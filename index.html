                <!-- Commenting out the hardcoded cleaning tips list so that the js can create this automatically -->
                <!-- <li><strong>Regular Schedule:</strong> Set a consistent cleaning schedule based on the size of your tank and the number of fish you have. Generally, a partial water change of 20-30% should be done every 1-2 weeks.</li>
                <li><strong>Gather Supplies:</strong> Before you start, gather all necessary supplies such as a siphon gravel cleaner, algae scrubber, buckets, dechlorinator, and a clean cloth or sponge.</li>
                <li><strong>Unplug Equipment:</strong> Turn off and unplug any electrical equipment like heaters and filters to ensure safety while cleaning.</li>
                <li><strong>Partial Water Change:</strong> Use a siphon gravel cleaner to remove debris from the substrate during the water change. Remove about 20-30% of the water and replace it with fresh, dechlorinated water.</li>
                <li><strong>Clean Decorations:</strong> Gently scrub and clean any decorations or ornaments in the tank using an algae scrubber or a cloth. Avoid using soap or chemicals that could harm the fish.</li>
                <li><strong>Glass/ Acrylic Cleaning:</strong> Clean the tank walls with an appropriate aquarium-safe glass or acrylic cleaner. Wipe away algae buildup without scratching the surface.</li>
                <li><strong>Filter Maintenance:</strong> Check the filter for debris and rinse the filter media in a bucket of tank water to avoid killing beneficial bacteria. Replace filter media as needed based on the manufacturer's recommendations.</li>
                <li><strong>Test Water Parameters:</strong> Regularly test the water for parameters like ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, and pH. This helps you monitor the tank's health and catch any issues early.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid Overfeeding:</strong> Overfeeding leads to excess waste and poor water quality. Feed your fish only what they can consume in a few minutes to minimize waste buildup.</li>
                <li><strong>Observe Fish Behavior:</strong> While cleaning, observe your fish for any signs of stress, disease, or abnormal behavior. This can help you address any health issues promptly.</li> -->

                <p class="tips__text">Sometimes, you've got to hit the road with your fin-tastic friends.

                    <!-- <li><strong>Plan Ahead:</strong> Give yourself ample time to plan for the trip. Rushing can lead to mistakes and stress for both you and your fish.</li>
                    <li><strong>Choose the Right Container:</strong> Use a sturdy, leak-proof container to transport your fish. A plastic fish bag or a dedicated fish transport container with a secure lid is ideal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prepare Fish Bags:</strong> If using plastic bags, make sure they are specifically designed for transporting fish. Fill each bag with some tank water to keep the fish comfortable and minimize stress.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tank Water:</strong> Use water from the fish tank to fill the bags or containers. This helps maintain water parameters and reduces stress for the fish.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gradual Acclimation:</strong> Before your trip, get your fish accustomed to being in the transport container by placing it in the tank for short periods. This reduces the shock of being suddenly moved.</li>
                    <li><strong>Limit Food:</strong> Stop feeding your fish a day or two before the trip. This reduces waste production and keeps water quality stable during travel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secure the Container:</strong> Seal the bags or containers securely to prevent leaks and ensure that fish can't jump out.</li>
                    <li><strong>Insulate and Stabilize:</strong> Wrap the transport container in towels or newspaper to insulate it from temperature changes. Place the container in a stable, secure box to prevent excessive movement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Temperature Consideration:</strong> Maintain a stable temperature during travel. If it's cold, consider using a small, battery-powered heater or hand warmers (secured outside the container) to keep the water warm.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stay Informed:</strong> Research local regulations and airline policies regarding traveling with fish. Some airlines have specific guidelines for carrying aquatic animals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid Stressful Journeys:</strong> If the travel time is too long or stressful, consider leaving your fish with a trusted friend, family member, or a professional pet sitter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stay Calm:</strong> Your fish can sense your emotions. Stay calm and handle the fish gently to minimize stress for both you and them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Emergency Kit:</strong> Carry an emergency kit containing essentials like dechlorinator, water conditioner, a net, and a small aquarium heater in case of unexpected situations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Health Check:</strong> Before and after the journey, monitor your fish for any signs of stress, injury, or illness. Quarantine them if necessary before returning them to the main tank.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gradual Return:</strong> When you arrive at your destination, gradually acclimate your fish to their new environment just as you would when introducing them to a new tank.</li> -->
